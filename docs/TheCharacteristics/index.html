    <h1>The Characteristics of a Christian Challange</h1>
    <p>
 The Bible says a lot about how we as Christians are to live. When I read the Bible I am always finding more characteristics of a Christian. But there is no way I could list them all on this site.

 So I dare you, challange you, and encourage you to read, study and meditate in your Bible to see how you as a Christian should live.

        or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
        5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them:
        for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
        upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
        6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 
        <b>Exodus 20:4-6</b>

        <h1>3. Christians do not misuse the name of God</h1>

            nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle,
            nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
            11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
            the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day:
            wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
