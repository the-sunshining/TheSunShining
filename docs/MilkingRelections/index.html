            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">Introduction</h3>
            
            <p>
Hi, it's me N.C.R. here again.<br/>
It has been about three years since I originally wrote "milking devotional". I don't know why I chose to title it that and I didn't like the front cover.
</p><p>
I have been thinking about updating the book for a while. It is now 2020, a lot has happened since 2017. This is now going on the fourth year since our family got our first milk cow. And it's kind of funny. I am standing outside the milking barn writing this book. Though I have done some milking over the last three years, it is mainly my brother Sam's responsibility. Milking is not really a 2 person job, but … We started in 2017 with a wild cow. She became quite tame and so in 2018 and 2019 I didn't help too much with the milking at all. I have been so busy the last three summers, They are just kind of a blur in my mind. 
</p><p>
But this year, 2020, our good old milk cow didn't have a calf. So this year 2020 we are starting with a new wild cow. And also this summer I am not so busy. But I am using all my spare time to write, so I guess you could say I am quite busy.
</p><p>
I am looking forward to this summer, and what I will write this summer. They say you are supposed to write the introduction last. But I have never done that. So as I am writing this and as you are reading this the updated new content that I am writing this summer is unknown to both of us. The original content I wrote in 2017 can be found in part one of this book. The new content that I am writing can be found in part two. And because I told you I write the introduction first I won't bother to change anything in this introduction to past tense once I write part two of this book.
</p><p>
Well, I hope you enjoy this book, even though it was written in 2017-2020. I hope that no matter when you are reading this book you will enjoy it.

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">I was born to milk</h3>
            <p>
                Some people believe in predestination. <br/>
                I do not.<br/>
                 I believe that people can determine their own destination.<br/>
                Where will you end up?<br/>
                 Heaven or Hell?
                </p><p>
                    Just a few weeks ago when I was learning to milk my aunt said to my brother Sam,
                     “You were born to milk.”<br/>
                      I jokingly said, “I must not have been born to milk.”
                    </p><p>
                 I do not believe that I was predestined to not milk, but if I did believe that I would probably never have been able to milk. Likewise if you believe you are predestined to hell that is most likely where you will end up. 
                </p><p>
                Since I am able to milk you should be able to make it to heaven. You are not predestined to hell. I know you do not want to end up there, so don’t.

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">It is harder than it looks</h3>
            <p>
                When I was a little kid I loved to pretend I was milking a cow.
                 I squeezed pencils like they were teats.
                  It was so easy to imagine I was milking a cow.
            </p><p>
                But did you know that milking a cow is harder than you can imagine,
                 it is even harder than it looks. 
               Many people think being a Christian is easy.
                They think that as soon as you become a Christian life will be easy.
                 But being a Christian is harder than you can imagine.
                  Many people have given up being Christians,
                   because it was harder than they thought it was.
            </p><p>
                Milking a cow was harder than I thought.
                 If I would have given up milking a cow I would never have learned how,
                  nor would I have ever become good at it.
                   Likewise if you give up being a Christian you will never make it to heaven. 
            </p><p>
               <b>Tip</b>: Do not give up. 
               (Whether you are learning to milk or whatever, do not give up.)

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">Milk is born clean</h3>
            <p>
                Milk is clean as long as it is in the udder. But no matter how hard you try to keep it clean it gets dirty just about as soon as it leaves the udder. Sometimes the milk gets too dirty we have throw it out. All the milk we do keep though no matter how clean it looks needs to be strained. And some milk even once it is strained still has specks in it. 
            </p><p>
                Men we are just about like milk, except we are dirty before we even leave the womb. Also milk can not choose to be cleaned or stay dirty, we can choose.
              <br/>
                Do you want to be cleaned?<br/>
                Christ died for you so that you may be washed as white as snow with his blood.
            </p><p>
               You also unlike milk can choose to get dirty again if you want. <br/>
               And if you get too dirty you will get thrown out because God cannot use you.<br/>
               Try to keep your life pure so that God may use you.

            <p>
                Like I said in the last chapter milk is born clean, but it gets dirty.<br/>
                Does anyone know how it gets dirty?<br/>
            </p><p>
                It gets dirty because of its surroundings. The cleaner the surroundings the cleaner the milk. The dirtier the surroundings the dirtier the milk.
            </p><p>
                Milk does not have the ability to choose its surroundings. But we do. Choose your friends wisely. 
            </p><p>
                The cleaner your friends the cleaner you will be.
            </p><p>
                <b>Tip</b>: Make sure your surroundings are clean. (Whether your milking surroundings or your life surroundings.)

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">What is faith?</h3>
            <p>
                Squeeze. Squeeze. Um there is no milk coming out. This has happened to me a few times, and when it happens I can choose to believe it will not come. Or I can have faith that it will come. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's say I choose to have faith it will come out. What does that mean? What is faith?
            </p><p>
                To me the word faith and believe is the same thing. But faith is a little a little more than just believing. Faith is doing because you believe. You may believe something will happen, but unless you act on what you believe you have no faith. Believing without doing is not faith; doing without believing is not faith. Both believing and doing is faith.
            </p>
            <p>
               I may believe that milk will come out, but what good will believing do if I do not squeeze!
            </p>

            <p>
                Some people think that because they are Christians and because God loves them, that God will automatically bless them. But that is about the same as saying a cow will milk itself just because it loves you and just because you are a milker. God, no matter how much he loves you, cannot automatically bless you for being a Christian. Nor can your cow milk itself, no matter how much it loves you.
            </p><p>
                If you want to be blessed you have to be more than a Christian, you have to be christlike.<br/>
                If you want milk you will have to be more than a milker, you will have to milk.<br/>
                (Note: Everyone knows a Christian is to be Christlike, and that a milker milks.)

            <p>
                I am surprised that many people still think chocolate milk comes from brown cows.
            </p><p>
                “Regardless of skin color, wealth, or nationality all cows produce the same white milk, though different cows may produce milk that tastes a little bit different, and with different amounts of cream.”
            </p><p>
               Now even though a lot of people think chocolate milk comes from brown cows, it is probably not likely that you think chocolate milk comes from brown cows. But did you know that there is something which can be compared to thinking brown cows produce chocolate milk, and it is very likely that you could be guilty of it.
            </p><p>
               It is a big sin, and it is called prejudice. Basically prejudice is judging people too early, before you know them, and for the wrong reasons, like their skin color, wealth, health, or nationality.
            </p><p>
              <b>Tip</b>: You can never be too slow to judge, so make sure you do not judge too quickly.

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">Milking takes time</h3>
            <p>
                Milking takes time, but you know what it is not the only thing that takes time. In Matthew 28:18-20 Jesus commands us to go into all the world.
            </p><p>
                "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, 
                All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
             Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
              and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
               I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen." 
               - <b>Matthew 28:18-20 KJV</b>
            </p><p>
               That is something that takes a lot of time. Unless you put any time into that you will never succeed in doing what Jesus commanded. Unless you put any time into milking you will never get milk.
            </p><p>
               How much time do you spend milking each day?<br/>
               How much time do you spend sharing the good news?<br/>
               How does that amount of time compare?<br/>
               You should spend time each day sharing the good news.<br/>
               And if you have a cow you should spend more time sharing the good news than milking it.

            <p>
  Maybe it's the books I have been reading this spring or something. But recently I have been thinking about how we have been blessed so that we may bless others. You may be wondering how this relates to us and our milk cow? Well here's how: We have been blessed with a milk cow and with milk. In previous years we have been blessed with more than enough milk. An abundance of milk actually. And it would be a shame if we let it go to waste. That is why we love sharing milk with our family and friends. Giving when you have a lot is easy.

  What do you have an abundance of that you could share?<br/>
   Giving when you don't have as much is well it is much harder. It requires some sacrifice.
            </p><p>
This year we are not getting as much milk as we have been getting other years. But we are getting enough. And with blessing comes responsibility to share and bless others. So even though it is harder this year we are still giving milk to our friends and family.

            <p>
                "A few years ago I wrote this book titled "Milking Devotional". Milking time is a great time to think. This evening I was thinking about all the variables and factors that affect and influence the result of our milking time. Our cow is a little wild, so it is quite a challenge to milk her. One unexpected sound or wrong move could frighten her and we could lose the milk. It makes me think about creation and how we were created and how we became what we are. There are just so many reasons it could not have happened by chance and so much evidence that there is a creator. The evidence for God is overwhelming. And there are so many factors and variables that have made us what we are. If you ask me, I would say God is trying to make all of us into masterpieces. I know our cow will be a good milk cow when we are done with her."

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">What yet can we learn?</h3>
            <p>
                This morning as I am standing here struggling to come up with more ideas for this book I am wondering what can we yet learn from milking and milk? We have learned so much, it could be tempting to think we have learned all there is to learn from cows and milking them. But the truth of the matter is that we can always learn more. And I think sometimes as Christians we do the same thing with the Bible. But the truth of the matter is that no matter how much you have learned from the Bible. The more you study it the more you can learn from it.

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">Stating the Obvious</h3>
            <p>
                The cow needs more water. The cow needs more grass. The cow barn needs to be cleaned out. NCR will you quit stating the obvious. No, I will not. Stating the obvious is and can be good. But what is even better is doing the obvious, or in other words, doing what needs to be done. Sure the cow needs more water, but who is going to give it water? 
              <br/>
                Are you? <br/>
              Am I?
            </p><p>
                Actions speak louder than words. There is nothing wrong about stating the obvious. The question is who will do what needs to be done? 
            </p><p>
                <b>Milking Tip</b>: Do the obvious. Do what needs to be done. Do the right thing.

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle"> Spoke too soon - Picking up bad habits</h3>
            <p>
                Our cow is a good cow. Or is she? I think we started calling her a good cow too soon. She started picking up bad habits. It seems like it is that way for everything. You get it to a good state then it gets worse. That is also the way we are. We are either becoming better or we are becoming worse. 
            </p><p>
                Most likely if you get to a good spot you start getting worse. Here is a personal example from my last few weeks. A few weeks ago I started waking up at 6:00 to have morning devotions. I would wake up and go out to our library. I would then have about an hour of amazing time spent with God. The first week I did it without my phone. That first week was amazing. But then I started bringing my phone out and started spending about half the time I used to with God. My phone was just too distracting. When something like that happens you need to restart. I know I need to restart having morning devotions without my phone.
            </p><p>
                Working ourselves should be easier than working with a milk cow. But it can be harder because we are working with ourselves. 
            </p><p>
                Can you think of something good you need to restart or something good that you need to start?

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">Milking Takes Time - and Effort</h3>
            <p>
                I don't want to repeat the same things I said in the first part of the book, but I don't know if I discussed this topic thoroughly in the first part. Milking takes time. And something I want to add here is that milking takes effort.
            </p><p>
                You might make the time to go out and milk the cow, but unless you put any effort into actually milking a cow you won't get any milk. That can be the way it is with other things in life. You may make time to do something but unless you actually put any effort into doing it, well, then what is the use of making time to do it.

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
It is only June 22, a few days into summer. And already I feel like I have written enough for this book. I could probably try to force myself to continue writing all summer, but I feel as if that would take away from what the book is, and from what I want the book to be. Sure a lot more could be learned from cow milking and from milk in general. But as I keep telling my brother Sam "you have to learn when to stop". I don't know if that is something I need to learn, because I am stopping writing. But even though I am stopping writing milking reflections, I won't stop learning. And neither should you.
            </p><p>
                Learning which things you need to stop and conclude and which things you need to continue takes wisdom from above.

"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby."
<b>- 1 Peter 2:2</b>
</p><p>
"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. 
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
<b>- Hebrews 5:12‭-‬14</b>

"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able."
