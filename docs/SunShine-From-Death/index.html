    <h2>Intro (It is too bad to be true)</h2>
    <p>
 Have you ever heard the phrase “it is to good to be true”.
    </p><p>
Did you know that there are also things that are to bad to be true? Just a few hours ago my brother died.
</p><p>
The people who were here to help us asked us if we had any question.
I had one question “Is he really dead?”.
It was just too hard to believe.

    <h2>Are quads heavy?</h2>
    <p>
        Are quads heavy?<br/>
        I don't really know.<br/>
       When Sam came running into the house and said that Clayton might be dead, I quickly put on my boots, 
       without socks, and beat everyone to the crash site.
        Before anyone else got there I already had the quad lifted off Clayton.
         I do not really know how heavy that quad was, but it felt light.
         God must have helped me lift the quad off of Clayton. 
    </p><p>
       As you go through the grieving process know this:
        “God wants to help you with anything, no matter what.”
    </p><p>
       If you have just lost a loved one I just want to let you know that God wants to help you.

       God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. <br/>

        SunShine from Death<br/>
        Can death bring sunshine into lives?<br/>
      It depends on how you let death affect you. Death can bring a lot of suffering; pain; and darkness. But it can also bring a lot of light.
      Death can make you stop in your tracks and think, it can draw you closer to God, and much more. <br/>
      Have you just lost a loved one?<br/>
      It’s OK to grieve. But will you allow death to bring some light into your life?

        My brother died just yesterday and that sent me into a writing spree.

        Everyone has their own way to deal with grief. Reading and writing is my way. 
       How do you deal with grief?<br/>
       Find your way to deal with grief, and then do it. If crying is your way to deal with grief, go ahead and cry. But whatever way you deal with grief make sure you don’t do it too much, you still have a life to live.

    <h2>Why God?</h2>
    <p>
        Just yesterday my brother died in a quad accident. <br/>
       All that is within me wants to cry out “Why God?”. <br/>
       Why our family? Why Clayton? <br/>
       There are thousands of other people that could have died, why God, did Clayton die?<br/>
       In asking God those questions, it sounds as if I am blaming God for the death.<br/>
       I am not really, but there are many people who do blame God. <br/>
       “God wants to help you, but He can’t if you blame Him.”<br/>
       It’s OK to question God, but do not blame Him. <br/>

    <h2>Are you prepared for death?</h2>
    <p> 
        “Are you prepared for death?”<br/>
        Death can be sudden and can come before you expect it.<br/>
       Just a while ago my brother died(This was literaly written within hours of my brothers death).
       He was just 14 years old. He could have lived to be over 80 years. Most teenagers never think of death.
    </p><p>
       But did you know<br/>
       "An average of 16,375 teenagers 12–19 years died in the United States every year from 1999 to 2006."
    </p><p>
       That is a big number.
       You may have just lost a loved one, you could very well be the next person to die.
       Are you ready for death?       
</p>
<p>
 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.

        When something as big and as tragic as a death takes place people may blame themselves a little.<br/>

       or Why didn’t I do that? Are a few questions asked when someone dies.<br/>
        Trust me there was nothing you could have done that would have prevented the death.<br/>
       “There is nothing you can do to prevent death.”<br/>
       There may have been many things you could have done differently, but don’t blame yourself.<br/>

    <h2>You cannot take their place</h2>
    <p>
        My brother died just a week ago. For (just) a few days after his death I had a feeling that I would have to take my brothers place. <br/>
      Have you just lost a brother or sister and feel like you need to take their place?<br/>
      Everybody is unique, special, and different. You could not possibly take your brother or sisters place, you are you and you cannot be anyone else. Your parents need you, they do not need you to take your sibling's place.

    <h2>“In blessing thee Lord I will bless thee, and in cursing thee Lord I would never.”</h2>
    <p>
        This was something I was singing after Clayton’s death. 
    </p><p>
         Satan tries his hardest to get people to curse God. Bringing death is one way to do that. Sometimes people do curse God. But did you know that God is not the reason behind your troubles. Satan because he wants you to curse God creates as much pain as he can for you. So when you are hurt it is not God that needs cursed but Satan.
